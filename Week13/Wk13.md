1. The only challenge I faced in this lab was realizing that I had to put the quote lengths right after the quotes because at first I tried to stack the quote_len statements but ran into repetition errors when outputing to the quotes.txt file. Otherwise, everything was easily to follow after reading the lecture notes.



```assembly
SECTION .data
    filename db 'quotes.txt', 0

    quote1 db 'To be, or not to be, that is the question.', 10
    quote1_len equ $ - quote1

    quote2 db 'A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.', 10
    quote2_len equ $ - quote2

    quote3 db 'Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.', 10
    quote3_len equ $ - quote3

    quote4 db 'No legacy is so rich as honesty.', 10
    quote4_len equ $ - quote4

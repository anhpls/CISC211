2. The challenges of this week's programming assignment was optimizing the code by using loops and trying to understand where to incorporate loops that would help create a more concise, clean code. I started with the basic code of printing each letter and tried to understand where loops/procedures would be useful. This would occur for the outputs as in printing each letter as well as printing the newlines. Then looping through A-Z by incrementing each loop interval. I used pops/pushes in order to save registers that would be affected in the program, such as when the registers were used for sys_write (outputting), to ensure that there were no overwrites on registers that would cause conflict and errors.
